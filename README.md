# Hi there!

I am currently a  First class Physics (MPhys) graduate from the University of Manchester. I originate from Greece, where I attended secondary education and competed in Maths, Physics and Chemistry competitions. 

During my time at university, I have undertaken multiple internships revolving around programming and data analysis. My most recent work experience has been with the LHCb team at The University of Manchester, where I studied the matter/antimatter asymmetry in D0 meson decays. I have a deep-rooted passion for the implementation of machine learning/data analysis in a variety of physics fields. My selected MPhys project revolved around the geometrical interpretation of medical images using machine learning and its potential application in cancer research.

In the future, I am hoping to further explore the tech industry, and improve my skills by becoming a software engineer.
